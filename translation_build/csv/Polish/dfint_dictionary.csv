"Please maintain your dignity.","Prosz© zachowaj godnoòÜ."
"What do you care how I speak or how I live?","Co ciebie obchodzi jak m¢wi© lub jak æyj©?"
"I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.","Dostrzegam miejsce na zachowanie przyzwoitoòci, ale æycie w ten spos¢b jest wyczerpuj•ce."
